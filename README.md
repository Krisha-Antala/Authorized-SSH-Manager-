# Authorized-SSH-Manager
An interactive, menu-driven SSH management tool written in Python, designed for authorized remote administration and cybersecurity education.

# Authorized SSH Session Management Tool

## Overview
This project is an authorized SSH session management tool developed for
cybersecurity learning in a controlled lab environment.

It allows secure connection to multiple Linux systems using valid credentials
and demonstrates how SSH sessions are established, monitored, and logged.

## Ethical Disclaimer
This project is intended **strictly for educational purposes** and must only be
used on systems where explicit permission has been granted.
Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.

## Features
- Secure SSH session handling
- Multiple host management
- Command execution on authorized systems
- Logging for auditing and analysis
- Error handling and session control
